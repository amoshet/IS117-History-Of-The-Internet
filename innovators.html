      <h1>The Innovators</h1>
	<p>
	  This section centers around the accessibility and engagement that certain social sites have allowed, like the creators of sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Digg, and Youtube. Where television was once an avenue difficult to traverse, the broadcasting ability of such social sites has made it possible for anyone to express their ideas, talents, or entertainment to anyone willing to view it.

	<p><br>For example, Digg gives bloggers the same importance as official news sources, as long as people are reading it and buying into the individual. This takes us into how the music industry had to adapt to the boom of internet downloads and the accessibility to any music because people did not have to buy their music like they once had to. Even though people knew it was illegal, people still found it acceptable to do because it was behind a screen and it became mainstream action.</p>
	<p>This was harmful for both the studios who produce the music and the artists who made it. This went as far as Orek, producer of The Rolling Stones, and his lawyers wanting Napster users who had downloaded music to be banned from the site, going to the extreme of making a list of everyone who participated. This ultimately comes back to the fact that the internet opens new opportunities of distribution that are out of their control and people have more power with their ability to choose outlets and download data. As stated before, sites like youtube, myspace, and facebook and the social networking they brought gave people more opportunity to engage in the community and be their own advocates. This became known as the internet era, or Web 2.0.</p>
