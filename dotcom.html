      <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
	<p>
	  Its early 1993 and the Internet is not nearly where it is today. Certainly, the ability to transfer data globally and the elements like the World Wide Web have been revolutionary but only 2.3% of the population is actually online because unless you were a techie it was not user friendly. Until the release of the Mosaic browser came about, a user friendly internet browser that showed pictures alongside texts. Suddenly, the internet wasnt as difficult to use and astonishingly the internet usage went up 1,000%. As the web started to really pump, this is when entrepreneurs started to make their moves to capitalize on this opportunity with all the untapped potential.

	<p><br>All of a sudden, all these Dot Com companies started showing up. From online retailers, to search engines, early social media websites. The real gold rush is in the late 1995s, when Netscape communications launched its very own internet browser and even had its own navigation pane. This completely took out Mosaic, however Netscape was heavy on costs and was losing a lot of money in that area. This didnt stop them, they decided to go public on the stock market and overnight their price doubled from their opening ball date. They were valued at 2.7 billion dollars in a matter of minutes. This is the start of the Internet age, it became cool to be online and somehow be a part of the hype. </p>
