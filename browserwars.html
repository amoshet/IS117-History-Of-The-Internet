	<ul>
	  <br>
	  <li>In 1992, Erwise was created which was an Internet Browser and the first to have a graphical interface.</li>
	  <li>In 1993, Mosaic was created and this is what popularized surfing the web. </li>
	  <li>In 1994, Mosaic influenced many more browsers to follow including Netscape Navigator, which became the most popular web browser at the time accounting for 90% of the web usage in 1995.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Alongside these Browser come ups, in the early 90s companies like AOL started to provide Dial-Up internet access. Dial Up is a method of connecting to the internet via a telephone line and to further explain the line was connected to a Modem and the other end was plugged into the phone jack. This was the period in which you couldnt use the telephone and the internet at the same time. </p>
