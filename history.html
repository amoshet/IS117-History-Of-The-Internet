      <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
	<p>
	  The Internet got its start over 50 years ago and computers back then would physically fill up entire rooms. Scientists and Researchers would use them to communicate during the Cold War. It was useful to them because if one computer went down, they could be sure that the others would not follow.

	  <li>In 1962, a researcher named J.C.R. Licklider proposed the idea of a network of computers that would talk to one another.</li>
          <li>In 1969, the first ever message was sent from one computer to another over the Arpanet (Advanced Research Products Agency, governments computer network at the time). One PC was located in UCLA and the other at Stanford, all the initial message said was, LOGIN and it didnt fail or crash the network. Stanford only received the LO and by the end of the year about 4 computers were connected to this network.</li>
          <li>In 1971, the university of Hawaiis aloha net was added, followed by various networks in London and Norway, two years later.</li>
	  <li>Additionally, Ray Tomlinson was developing the first system to send mail back and forth between users of Arpanet which was eventually classified as EMAIL.</li>
	  <li>There still needed to be a way to computers communicate over a network, this is where Vinton Cerf comes in and he invented a way to introduce computers across the globe to each other in a virtual space, which was later called, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP).</li>
	  <li>In the 1980s scientists and researchers used Cerfs protocol to send data back and forth.</li>
	  <li>In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, and to emphasize clearer this was no longer just a sharing space for scientists anymore, this was an entire network of information that was accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</li>
